  "Coronary artery disease (CAD): This is the most common cause of heart attacks. CAD develops when a buildup of fatty deposits (plaque) narrows the coronary arteries. The plaque can be made up of cholesterol, fat, and other substances found in the blood."
  "Coronary artery spasm: This is a sudden, temporary tightening of the muscles in the walls of a coronary artery. A coronary artery spasm can reduce blood flow to the heart and cause a heart attack.",
  "Myocarditis: This is an inflammation of the heart muscle. Myocarditis can be caused by a virus, bacteria, or a reaction to a medication. Myocarditis can weaken the heart muscle and make it difficult for the heart to pump blood effectively. This can lead to heart failure and a heart attack.",
  "Aortic dissection: This is a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, the largest artery in the body. The tear can cause blood to flow between the layers of the aorta, which can weaken the aorta and cause it to burst. Aortic dissection can also block blood flow to the heart and other organs.",
